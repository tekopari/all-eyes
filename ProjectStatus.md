# Status as of Dec 3rd, 2012 #


# Goals #
The goal of this project is to prototype a defense-in-depth mechanism to take quick action after the recognition of a breach or abnormality in a predefined-runtime-profile of a system (https://code.google.com/p/all-eyes/wiki/ReadMeFirst).

For the NYU-POLY Application Security class project, we prototyped the concept on Ubuntu.


# Progress #
As of today, `AllEyes` components ('ae' daemon, `aeProxy`, `aeManager`(Android App), monitors) are prototyped, integrated and tested on Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin release).

We completed one cycle of static and run time analysis of the code.

We completed adding the authentication and authorization of the ae message traffic between the aeManager and the aeProxy.  Authentication supports both OAuth authentication and username/password authentication.

Entire project history is documented in project-wiki and issues sections enabling new developers to quickly come up to speed and contribute to the project.

We performed integration testing of all the components during which more than 300,000 events generated by the monitors were processed by `aeProxy` and `aeManager` Android Application.


# Limitations #
  * `AllEyes` has not been tested on an embedded platform.
  * Android Application has been tested only on one Android device.
  * Some of the monitor events are simulated.
  * Still there are open defects to be fixed.
