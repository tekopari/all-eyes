#summary The protocol specification for monitors, 'ae' daemon, and aeManager (the Android Manager)

=MONITORS/AE-DAEMON/AE-MANAGER PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION=

Between the 'ae' adaemon and monitors, the `Aeproxy/AeManager`(Android Manager) and 'ae' daemon, the protocol is request/response style and there are 2 class of messages:
   * Control Message
   * Event Message

The same protocol is used to communicate between ae manager (i.e. Android client) and the ae daemon.  

_The maximum message length is 1203 bytes.  Any message longer than that will be considered invalid and ae daemon will restart the monitor.

=Control Message=

The control message is defined to be

   ===_*`[:<Text-Header>:]`*_===

Where the _*`[:`*_ is the beginning marker and the _*`:]`*_ is the ending marker.

The field _*`<Text-Header>`*_ is defined to be

   ===_*`<version>:<msg-id>:<msg-type>:<name>`*_===

Where the  _*:*_ is the sub-field delimiter. Each sub-field is defined in the tables below.

=== _*`<version>`*_ - Version ==
|| *Value* || *Comment* ||
|| 10 || Protocol version string ||

===_*`<msg-id>`*_ - Message ID ===
|| *Value* || *Comment* ||
|| Unique Number || A string, combination of 16 digits, append char '-', append count (1 digit to 6 digits). The 16 digits are from a combination of a high resolution timer that may not corresponds to a real time. The count is the message counter of the monitor process. ||

===_*`<msg-type>`*_ - Message type===
|| *Value* || *Comment* ||
|| 00 || The HELLO message ||
|| 11 || The ACK message ||
|| 22 || The event message ||
|| 33 || The action message ||
|| 77 || The OAUTH authentication message ||
|| 88 || The userid and password authentication message ||

===_*`<name>`*_ - Monitor name===
|| *Value* || *Comment* ||
|| AE || For ae daemon ||
|| SM || For socket monitor ||
|| PM || For proc monitor ||
|| FM || For file monitor || 
|| FD || For file descriptor monitor || 
|| SF || For ae itself monitor ||
|| AM || For ae manager ||

=Event Message=

The event message is defined to be

   ===_*`[:<Text-Header>:<event-id>:<status-op>:<action-list>:<text>:]`*_===

Where the _*`[:`*_ is the beginning marker, the _*`:]`*_ is the ending marker, and the _*`:`*_ is the field delimiter.

The field _*`<Text-Header>`*_ is defined under the control message header above. For the rest of fields, they are defined in the tables below.

===_*`<event-id>`*_ - Event associated with the monitor sensors===
|| *Value* || *Comment* ||
|| 0001 || The Black issue. Reported by socketmon. ||
|| 0002 || The White issue. Reported by socketmon. ||
|| 0003 || Expected process is missing. Reported by procmon. ||
|| 0004 || File checksum mismatch. Reported by filemon. ||
|| 0005 || File descriptor changed.  Reported by filedescr ||
|| etc || Other event codes ... ||
|| 9999 || initial channel validation event ||

===_*`<status-op>`*_ - Status code or opcode of the monitor===
|| *Value* || *Comment* ||
|| 00 || GREEN ||
|| 01 || ORANGE ||
|| 11 || RED ||

===_*`<action-list>`*_ - An array of possible action list for that event defined by _*`<event-id>`*_===
|| *Value* || *Comment* ||
|| A0 || Ignore ||
|| A1 || Log The Message||


===_*`<text>`*_ - A text message to be transmitted===
|| *Value* || *Comment* ||
|| ASCII String || Text message. Maximum of 80 chars ||

=Authentication Message=

The control message is defined to be

   ===_*`[:<Text-Header>:]`*_===

Where the _*`[:`*_ is the beginning marker and the _*`:]`*_ is the ending marker.

The field _*`<Text-Header>`*_ is defined to be

   ===_*`<version>:<msg-id>:<msg-type>:<userid>:<authentication>`*_===

Where the  _*:*_ is the sub-field delimiter. Each sub-field is defined in the tables below.

The content of the authentication field is defined by the message type as defined in the following table.
|| *Message Type* || *Userid Field* ||
|| 77 || The user's Google email address||
|| 88 || The user's ae userid||

The content of the authentication field is defined by the message type as defined in the following table.
|| *Message Type* || *Authentication Field* ||
|| 77 || The OAUTH access token from Google ||
|| 88 || The password of the user ||



=Examples=

===Initial channel validation===
This is special request/response message pair only happens at the time the connection is just established for validating that the connection between ae-daemon and monitor is a legitimate connection.
|| SOCKETMON sends || _*`[:10:143456324323234-234:22:SM:9999:00:A0:]`*_ ||
|| AE_DAEMON replies || _*`[:10:143456324323234-234:11:AE:]`*_ ||


===Hello message, it is sent by the monitor every 30 seconds===
|| SOCKETMON sends || _*`[:10:143456324345234-456:00:SM:]`*_ ||
|| AE_DAEMON replies || _*`[:10:143456324345234-456:11:AE:]`*_ ||

===Report the required listening TCP port 22 is down with possible action of ignore===
|| SOCKETMON sends || _*`[:10:985765636438765-734:22:SM:0002:11:A0:22:]`*_ ||
|| AE_DAEMON replies || _*`[:10:985765636438765-734:11:AE:]`*_ ||

===Report the blacklisted port 80 is up with possible action of log the message===
|| SOCKETMON sends || _*`[:10:465748392014328-897:22:SM:0001:11:A1:80:]`*_ ||
|| AE_DAEMON replies || _*`[:10:465748392014328-897:11:AE:]`*_ ||

===Report the blacklisted port 80 is down (cleared) with possible action ignore===
|| SOCKETMON sends || _*`[:10:456281940583498-777:22:SM:0001:00:A0:80:]`*_ ||

=Protocol Message Flow between `AE_DAEMON` and `AeProxy`=
===Event update===
|| `AeProxy` sends || _*`[:10:143456324345288-812:00:AM:]`*_ ||
|| AE_DAEMON replies || Sends a list of events collected from monitors, Example: _*`[:10:465748392014328-897:22:SM:0001:11:A1:80:]`*_ _*`[:10:456281940583498-777:22:SM:0001:00:A0:80:]`*_ ||
